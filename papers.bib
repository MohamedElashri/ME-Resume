  title    = {Strip hit resolution of {CMS} {Tracker} analysis},
  abstract = {The CMS silicon tracker consists of two tracking devices utilizing semiconductor technology: the inner pixel and the outer strip detectors. They operate in a high-occupancy and high-radiation environment presented by particle collisions in the LHC. The tracker detectors occupy the region around the center of CMS, where the LHC beams collide, between 4 cm and 110 cm in radius and up to 280 cm along the beam axis. The pixel
detector consists of 66 million pixels, covering about 1 m{\textasciicircum}2
total area. It is surrounded by the strip tracker with 10 million read-out channels covering about 200 m{\textasciicircum}2 total area. In this study, details are given about the performance of the strip tracker at high occupancy with respect to local observables such as signal to noise ratio and hit reconstruction efficiency. Studies of strip hit resolution that affects the quality of track reconstruction.},

  abstract = {In this study, the concept of magnetically charged black hole is discussed through calculating the angular momentum (L) of its interaction with an electric test charge. Results confirm that the angular momentum form will agree with the prediction of no-hair theorem and we will show that L will depend on the distance between the charge and the black hole.},
