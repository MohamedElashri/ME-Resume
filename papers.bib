  title    = {Strip hit resolution of {CMS} {Tracker} analysis},
  abstract = {The CMS silicon tracker consists of two tracking devices utilizing semiconductor technology: the inner pixel and the outer strip detectors. They operate in a high-occupancy and high-radiation environment presented by particle collisions in the LHC. The tracker detectors occupy the region around the center of CMS, where the LHC beams collide, between 4 cm and 110 cm in radius and up to 280 cm along the beam axis. The pixel
detector consists of 66 million pixels, covering about 1 m{\textasciicircum}2
total area. It is surrounded by the strip tracker with 10 million read-out channels covering about 200 m{\textasciicircum}2 total area. In this study, details are given about the performance of the strip tracker at high occupancy with respect to local observables such as signal to noise ratio and hit reconstruction efficiency. Studies of strip hit resolution that affects the quality of track reconstruction.},

  abstract = {The mass difference between the {$\Omega_b^-$} and {$\Xi_b^-$} baryons is measured using proton-proton collision data collected by the LHCb experiment, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $9\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$, and is found to be $248.54 \pm 0.51\,\mathrm{(stat)} \pm 0.38\,\mathrm{(syst)}\,\mathrm{MeV}/c^2$. The mass of the {$\Omega_b^-$} baryon is measured to be $6045.9 \pm 0.5\,\mathrm{(stat)} \pm 0.6\,\mathrm{(syst)}\,\mathrm{MeV}/c^2$. This is the most precise determination of the {$\Omega_b^-$} mass to date. In addition, the production rate of {$\Omega_b^-$} baryons relative to that of {$\Xi_b^-$} baryons is measured for the first time in $pp$ collisions, using an LHCb dataset collected at a center-of-mass energy of $13\,\mathrm{TeV}$ and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $6\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. Reconstructing beauty baryons in the kinematic region $2<|\eta|<6$ and $p_T<20\,\mathrm{GeV}/c$ with their decays to a $J/\psi$ meson and a hyperon, the ratio $\frac{f_{\Omega_b^-}}{f_{\Xi_b^-}} \times \frac{\mathcal{B}(\Omega_b^- \to J/\psi \Omega^-)}{\mathcal{B}(\Xi_b^- \to J/\psi \Xi^-)} = 0.120 \pm 0.008\,\mathrm{(stat)} \pm 0.008\,\mathrm{(syst)}$, is obtained, where $f_{\Omega_b^-}$ and $f_{\Xi_b^-}$ are the fragmentation fractions of $b$ quarks into {$\Omega_b^-$} and {$\Xi_b^-$} baryons, respectively, and $\mathcal{B}$ represents the branching fractions of their respective decays.},

  abstract = {A flavor-tagged time-dependent angular analysis of the decay $B_s^0 \rightarrow \phi \phi$ is performed using $pp$ collision data collected by the LHCb experiment at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV, the center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 6 fb$^{-1}$. The CP-violating phase and direct CP-violation parameter are measured to be $\phi_{s\bar{s}} = -0.042 \pm 0.075 \pm 0.009$ rad and $|\lambda|=1.004\pm 0.030 \pm 0.009$, respectively, assuming the same values for all polarization states of the $\phi \phi$ system. In these results, the first uncertainties are statistical and the second systematic. These parameters are also determined separately for each polarization state, showing no evidence for polarization dependence. The results are combined with previous LHCb measurements using $pp$ collisions at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV, yielding $\phi_{s\bar{s}} = -0.074 \pm 0.069$ rad and $|\lambda|=1.009 \pm 0.030$. This is the most precise study of time-dependent CP violation in a penguin-dominated $B$ meson decay. The results are consistent with CP symmetry and with the Standard Model predictions.}

The $K^0_SK \pi$ invariant mass spectra from both decay modes reveal a rich content of charmonium resonances. New precise measurements of the $\eta_c$ and $\eta_c(2S)$ resonance parameters are performed and branching fraction measurements are obtained for $B^+$ decays to $\eta_c$, $J/\psi$, $\eta_c(2S)$ and $\chi_{c1}$ resonances. In particular, the first observation and branching fraction measurement of $B^+ \rightarrow \chi_{c0} K^0 \pi^+$ is reported as well as first measurements of the $B^+\rightarrow K^0K^+K^-\pi^+$ and $B^+\rightarrow K^0K^+K^+\pi^-$ branching fractions. Dalitz plot analyses of $\eta_c \rightarrow K^0_SK\pi$ and $\eta_c(2S) \rightarrow K^0_SK\pi$ decays are performed. A new measurement of the amplitude and phase of the $K \pi$ $S$-wave as functions of the $K \pi$ mass is performed, together with measurements of the $K^*_0(1430)$, $K^*_0(1950)$ and $a_0(1700)$ parameters. Finally, the branching fractions of $\chi_{c1}$ decays to $K^*$ resonances are also measured.},

The measured ratio is $\mathcal{B}(B^0 \to D^{*-}\tau^+\nu_{\tau})/\mathcal{B}(B^0 \to D^{*-}\pi^+\pi^-\pi^+)= 1.70 \pm 0.10^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is related to systematic effects. Using established branching fractions for the $B^0 \to D^{*-}\pi^+\pi^-\pi^+$ and $B^0 \to D^{*-} \mu^+\nu_\mu$ modes, the lepton universality test, $\mathcal{R}(D^{*-}) \equiv \mathcal{B}(B^0 \to D^{*-}\tau^+\nu_{\tau})/\mathcal{B}(B^0 \to D^{*-} \mu^+\nu_\mu)$ is calculated, $$ \mathcal{R}(D^{*-}) = 0.247 \pm 0.015 \pm 0.015 \pm 0.012 , $$ where the third uncertainty is due to the uncertainties on the external branching fractions. This result is consistent with the Standard Model prediction and with previous measurements.},

  abstract = {The very rare $D^{*}(2007)^0\to\mu^+\mu^-$ decay is searched for by analysing $B^-\to\pi^-\mu^+\mu^-$ decays. The analysis uses a sample of beauty mesons produced in proton-proton collisions collected with the LHCb detector between 2011 and 2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 9 fb$^{-1}$. The signal signature corresponds to simultaneous peaks in the $\mu^+\mu^-$ and $\pi^-\mu^+\mu^-$ invariant masses. No evidence for an excess of events over background is observed and an upper limit is set on the branching fraction of the decay at $\mathcal{B}(D^{*}(2007)^0\to\mu^+\mu^-) < 2.6\times 10^{-8}$ at $90\%$ confidence level. This is the first limit on the branching fraction of $D^{*}(2007)^0\to\mu^+\mu^-$ decays and the most stringent limit on $D^{*}(2007)^0$ decays to leptonic final states. The analysis is the first search for a rare charm-meson decay exploiting production via beauty decays.},
